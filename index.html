    <p id="aboutMe" class="aboutMeText">I began my coding journey at the age of twelve when I was faced with cartilage damage in my knees. While my knees were healing, and I couldn't engage in the physical world, I turned to the virtual one. While rehabilitating from my knee procedure, I dove into computer science, taking summer courses learning CSharp through ID Tech at CU Boulder.  
      I took advantage of my high school's independent study program by taking multiple online courses to learn GameMaker studio. I learned everything I could about scripting, physics, and how to stitch together a prototype. I created my first game, a top-down space shooter inspired by Galaga. I spent my free time focusing on different aspects of development. I spent several different days working on sprites, improving the AI, and the game cabinet. These experiences cemented my desire to learn programming and become a professional software developer.    
      While attending college, I worked in several software development teams making games, web applications, and game engines. As a result, I learned a lot about software, and in turn, these experiences made me a stronger teammate and leader. In addition, I learned essential skills to work collaboratively in software development teams.
      I am currently studying Full Stack Web development through Launch School while located in Seattle WA. I chose to study Web Development through Launch School because of the mastery based learning style they encourage and teach. Mastery is my path.
